# Face-Mask-Detection-and-Classification

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tensorflow 2.0 or higher
- Keras 2.0 or higher
- OpenCV 4.0 or higher

## Hardware Requirements
Running the code does not require any special hardware, it can run on any machine, even on tiny devices like Raspberry Pi.

## How the code works
OpenCv is used for face detection, then detected faces are fed into a model that predicts if the person is wearing a mask or not.

## About this project
This was my final project for my bachelor's degree.
I did all the work from gathering the data from different sources to writing the training script and training the model.

For now I'm only publishing the final results.
The training scripts and the dataset are going to be published soon.
