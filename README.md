# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection using Tensorflow and Keras.

this was my final project for my bachelor's degree.

I did all the work from gathering the data from different sources to writing the training script and training the model.

Basicly I'm using OpenCV for face detection and then the trained model to predict if the person is wearing a mask or not.
Running the code does not require anyh special hardware, it can run on any machine, even on tiny devices like Raspberry Pi.

For now I'm only publishing the final results.
the training scripts and the dataset are going to be published soon.

### output of the model:
