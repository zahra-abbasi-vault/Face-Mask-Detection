# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection using Tensorflow and Keras.
this was my final project for my bachelor's degree.
I did all the work from gathering the data to writing the training script and training the model.

Basicly I'm using OpenCV for face detection and then I'm using the trained model to predict if the person is wearing a mask or not.

For now I'm only publishing the final results.
the training scripts and the dataset are going to be published soon.

### output of the model:
